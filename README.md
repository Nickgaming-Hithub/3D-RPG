<h1>3D-RPG</h1>
<p>Version: v0.0.1</p>
<p>|Pre-Alpha|</p>
<p>This is a project I am working on, obviously. I don't plan on this being done anytime soon, updates will be available if you want to keep track. This does not have a name yet so I called it 3D-RPG because that is what im making. Im not sure if you are able to see the actual project because you cant run it in browser (I think three.js removed local file support).</p>
